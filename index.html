        "Dijkstra's algorithm (or Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF algorithm) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later." (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">-Wikipedia</a>)

        <br /><br />This is an interractive visual implementation which can generate a random undirected graph and use Dijkstra's algorithm to draw the shortest path between two randomly selected points, if such a path exists.
